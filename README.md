## About Me

I am currently a PhD candidate at the SFI Center for Research & Training in Machine Learning Labs, Technological University Dublin. My research focuses on **post hoc explanations for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using state transition representations** on univariate time series data, a key area within **Explainable AI (XAI)**. I have a passion for understanding the black-box nature of AI models and making machine learning more transparent and interpretable.

Prior to this, I completed my M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and data science. I have also had the privilege of teaching and mentoring students as an assistant professor.
